WORKOUT TRACKER

## Description

This is an exercise app built to test creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handling routes with Express.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Installation
This project requires Mongo be installed on your computer to handle database management. Whether a workbench program or the terminal is used to handle queries and data is optional. Robo 3T was used for development purposes. 

Clone this repo and keep the directory structure unchanged. Run the `npm install` command to ensure all dependencies are installed to prepare the environment. Using the CLI, change directory with `cd seeders` and then run the `node seed.js` command to grab the database schema and prepare it to handle data. After this is set up, change directory location back to the main folder and then run the `node server.js` command to launch the app. As it is set up to open in port 3000 locally, open your preferred web browser and use the url http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Sample

A working example of this app is deployed via Heroku and linked to Mongo Atlas to enable the database functionality. Visit the app here https://hector-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com/
